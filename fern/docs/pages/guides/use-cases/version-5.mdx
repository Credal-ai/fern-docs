# Improving your Internal Systems 

### Version 5:
1. User asks a question
2. Agent consults the shared FAQ and answer quickly if it exists
3. Otherwise, consult the company knowledge base to find the answer to the user’s question
4. If more information is required to answer to question… 
    1. If the inquiry is generic, or if the answer is incomplete, search the web for supplementary details. 
    2. If the question is about something not working in the product, consult the product specs knowledge base, and if no answer exists create a Jira ticket escalating the product bug
5. If the question is still unanswered and you need intenral company knowledge to do so,  escalate the question to the hiring manager via Slack
6. Respond to the user with what happened (and hopefully an answer!) while soliciting feedback about things that were unclear for the agent builder and hiring manager to make the process smoother
7. If provided, post that feedback in the private channel called #onboarding-feedback sent from the Credal bot with the body (user: xyz, feedback: abc)
