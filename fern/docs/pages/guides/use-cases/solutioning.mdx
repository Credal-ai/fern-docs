# Solutioning

The most exciting part of building Agents is your ability to exercise your creativity. We will start by laying out all of our ideas, and then planning incremental improvements to building a high functioning agent.


## Step 1: Decomposing the problem

What goes into onboarding a new hire at Credal? They’ve got to learn about a ton of existing internal processes, while ramping on understanding our product, not to mention the questions they’ll have about our company history (beyond the informal lore shared at team dinners). 

If I could build the perfect onboarding assistant to position my new hire for success, I’ll want it to do the following things:

1. Answer questions based on documentation from the knowledge base (employee guides, company overviews, product specifications, etc.) for an overview of company culture, values, and history
2. Identify common questions, compile an FAQ, and refer new hires to existing answers efficiently.
3. Escalate complicated or unanswerable questions to the hiring manager or relevant subject-matter experts via Slack.
4. Use trusted web sources to answer questions if necessary
5. Create Jira tickets if my new hire encounters any weird buggy behavior while onboarding  
6. Suggest relevant internal communities, Slack channels, or interest groups the new hire might find helpful or welcoming
7. Solicit feedback throughout onboarding via brief surveys or check-ins, so the assistant (and managers) can continually improve the process.


## Step 2: Planning the Build

We're going to do this in phases. 

To start building the solution, we will ask ourselves these core five questions:

1. What data is required?
2. What systems, services, databases, etc. do I need to interface with?
3. Where will I deploy this? In the web UI or in Slack, Teams, etc.?
4. Who is going to own this Agent's creation, improvement, and, ultimately, success?
5. What should happen when a user asks a question? 


The deeper you dig into the answer to these questions, the better. Assuming the answer to 4 is you, let's go ahead and build Version 1 of our solution!
