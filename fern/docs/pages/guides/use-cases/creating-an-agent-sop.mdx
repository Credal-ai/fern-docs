# Creating an Agent SOP

A well-crafted background prompt forms the cornerstone of any successful AI assistant. It establishes the context your AI needs to function correctly by detailing which data to draw from, what biases to prioritize, and when to call on specific sub-agents or tools. This foundation ensures that your assistant operates with consistency, clarity, and purpose—making context not just important, but essential for a high-quality user experience.

The key question to ask here is: What should happen when a user asks a question? The deeper you dig into the answer to that question, the better. Let's do this for our onboarding buddy assistant.

What goes into onboarding a new hire at Credal?

They’ve got to learn about a ton of existing internal processes, while ramping on understanding our product, not to mention the questions they’ll have about our company history (beyond the informal lore shared at team dinners). 

If I could build the perfect onboarding assistant to position my new hire for success, I’ll want it to do the following things:

1. Answer questions based on documentation from the knowledge base (employee guides, company overviews, product specifications, etc.) for an overview of company culture, values, and history
2. Identify common questions, compile an FAQ, and refer new hires to existing answers efficiently.
3. Escalate complicated or unanswerable questions to the hiring manager or relevant subject-matter experts.
4. Use trusted web sources to answer questions if necessary
5. Create tickets if my new hire encounters any weird buggy behavior while onboarding  
6. Suggest relevant internal communities, Slack channels, or interest groups the new hire might find helpful or welcoming
7. Solicit feedback throughout onboarding via brief surveys or check-ins, so the assistant (and managers) can continually improve the process.

Before we get into the weeds let's first decompose our use case by asking ourselves the following question:

Here’s the flow I think makes sense:

1. User asks a question
2. Agent consults the shared FAQ and answer quickly if it exists
3. Otherwise, consult the company knowledge base to find the answer to the user’s question
4. If more information is required to answer to question… 
    1. If the inquiry is generic, or if the answer is incomplete, search the web for supplementary details. 
    2. If the question is about something not working in the product, consult the product specs knowledge base, and if no answer exists create a Jira ticket escalating the product bug
5. If the question is still unanswered and you need intenral company knowledge to do so,  escalate the question to the hiring manager via Slack
6. Based on the question, find a list of Slack channels the user might want to join for up to date messaging and knowledge sharing
7. Respond to the user with what happened (and hopefully an answer!) while soliciting feedback about things that were unclear for the agent builder and hiring manager to make the process smoother
8. If provided, post that feedback in the private channel called #onboarding-feedback sent from the Credal bot with the body (user: xyz, feedback: abc) 

We are going to further decompose this process and build the Agent accomplishes this workflow!
