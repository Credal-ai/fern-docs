# Building Agents in Credal

This section will walk through how to create a new employee onboarding buddy. We will start by defining the types of agents you can build in Credal, and work our way up to the finished product.

To start building the solution, we will ask ourselves these core four questions:

1. What data is required?
2. What systems, services, databases, etc. do I need to interface with?
3. Where will I deploy this? In the web UI or in Slack, Teams, etc.?
4. Who is going to own this Agent's creation, improvement, and, ultimately, success?

Once you have the answer to these questions, decomposing the problem becomes easy. In the next section, we will outline all of the moving parts that go into creating an onboarding buddy.
