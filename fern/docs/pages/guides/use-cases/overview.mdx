# Building Agents in Credal

This section will walk through how to create a new employee onboarding buddy. We will start by defining the types of agents you can build in Credal, and work our way up to the finished product.

Before we get into the weeds let's first decompose our use case by asking ourselves the following questions:

1. What data is required?
2. What systems, services, databases, etc. do I need to interface with?
3. Where will I deploy this? In the web UI or in Slack, Teams, etc.?
4. Who is going to own this Agent's creation, improvement, and, ultimately, success?
