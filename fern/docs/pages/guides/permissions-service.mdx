Credal's Permission Service seamlessly synchronizes ACL information across a diverse range of data sources, including
Google Drive, Microsoft Sharepoint, Zendesk, Confluence, and more. We keep track of which users and groups are authorized
to perform what actions across the various data sources we integrate with.

Our retrieval APIs use this service to performantly return results from only the documents that a user has access to
in the source system.

The Permission Service API (Beta) gives developers direct access to the sync'ed ACL information - allowing them to build
custom applications that are connected to multiple data sources while maintaining a unified, access-controlled experience for end users.
