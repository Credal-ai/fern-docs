_This is a comprehensive in depth guide for Actions. If you’re just getting started, check out [Getting Started With AI Agents](/getting-started/agents/quick-start)._

Credal Actions allow users to create well defined actions that agents can then use proactively in helping you as your personal assistants.

Some basic examples of actions are:

- Address Validation
- Updating Info on collaboration tools (Confluence, Google Drive)
- Consulting with other agents

Actions are a powerful tool to make your agents even stronger than they already are.

## **Action Templates**

_It’s helpful to have a good sense of what you want your actions to do from the start, so you can set it up to achieve its objectives._

To get started:

1. There is an open source directory of action templates which can help you create actions

2. Think of templates as the skeleton of your action, an example being a template to update confluence docs.

3. You can find the open source templates library here: https://github.com/Credal-ai/actions-sdk

**Note:** You can create custom actions to interface with your private internal systems using the "Fetch from an API or trigger a webhook" template and pasting an OpenAPI spec!

Before we get to creating your first action lets learn about action parameters!
