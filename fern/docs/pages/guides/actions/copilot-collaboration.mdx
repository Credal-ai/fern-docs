_This is a comprehensive guide for Copilots calling. If you’re just getting started, check out [Getting Started With AI Copilots](/getting-started/copilots/quick-start)._

Copilots allow users to create dedicated assistants that can be honed in on specific use cases and tasks. With copilots calling copilots you can open up the space for more complex queries and responses.

This feature allows copilots to discover other copilots, so that one copilot can decide to call another to help answer a query. This can be useful when you have a complex query that requires multiple steps to answer, or when you want to combine the expertise of multiple copilots to provide a more comprehensive response.

## 1. **Setting your copilot as Discoverable**

_To allow your copilot to be called by other copilots, you need to change its discoverability settings._

To get started:

1. On your left sidebar, Select “Copilots”:

2. Select the copilot you want to set as discoverable by clicking it.

3. Navigate to the Deploy tab and enable the `Allow other Copilots to call this Copilot` option.

Great now your copilot is discoverable by other copilots!

## 2. **Connecting to a Copilot**

Now that you have some discoverable copilots, you can connect other copilots to it. To do this lets connect a copilot to the one we just made discoverable:

1. Navigate to the Configuration tab of the copilot you want calling other copilots and scroll down to Actions.

2. Search for the copilot you want to connect to, the action will be called `Consult [copilot name]`.

3. Once you request to connect it you'll be put in a `Pending Approval` state until the copilot you request approves you.

## 3. **Approving Connection Requests**

Once people discover your copilot and request to consult it you'll have a list of pending approvals, here's how to manage them:

1. On your discoverable copilot go to the Deploy Tab to see all pending approvals

![copilot_handle_approvals](/docs/assets/copilots/copilot-collaboration/copilot-handle-approvals.png)

2. Once approved that copilot will have the ability to consult your copilot - you'll also be able to remove the connection in the future.

## 4. **Using One Copilot to Call Another**

After the connection handshake has occurred you are now able to call that copilot from your own.

Requests will automatically be routed to the available copilot based on the exact instructions and documentation given to your orchestrator as well as the descriptions of the callee Copilots.  

**Note:** Copilots calling other copilots will only reach a max depth of 3 calls.
