_This is a comprehensive guide for configuring Copilots that work together. If you’re just getting started, check out [Getting Started With AI Copilots](/getting-started/copilots/quick-start)._

Copilots allow users to create dedicated assistants that can be honed in on specific use cases and tasks. With copilots calling copilots you can open up the space for more complex queries and responses.

This feature allows copilots to discover other copilots, so that one copilot can decide to call another to help answer a query. This can be useful when you have a complex query that requires multiple steps to answer, or when you want to combine the expertise of multiple copilots to provide a more comprehensive response.

## 1. **Setting your copilot as Discoverable**

_To allow your copilot to be called by other copilots, you need to change its discoverability settings._

To get started:

1. On your left sidebar, Select “Copilots”:

2. Select the copilot you want to set as discoverable by clicking it.

3. Navigate to the Deploy tab and make the Copilot callable.

Great now your copilot is discoverable by other copilots!

4. You can either make the Copilot visible to all other Copilots (only possible by an admin), or you can add an eligible caller to provide access on a per-Agent level. User level access coming soon. Today, you can restrict user level access to an action by deploying the Copilot to a private Slack channel or creating a user group (contact support@credal.ai to set this up).

## 2. **Connecting to a Copilot**

Now that you have some discoverable copilots, you can connect other copilots to it. To do this lets connect a copilot to the one we just made discoverable:

1. Navigate to the Configuration tab of the copilot you want calling other copilots and scroll down to Actions.

![copilot_actions_tab](/docs/assets/copilots/copilot-collaboration/copilot-actions.png)

2. Search for the copilot you want to connect to, the action will be called `[copilot name]`.

![copilot_connection_via_actions](/docs/assets/copilots/copilot-collaboration/copilot-add-copilot.png)

That's it!


## 3. **Using One Copilot to Call Another**

After the connection handshake has occurred you are now able to call that copilot from your own.

Requests will automatically be routed to the available copilot based on the exact instructions and documentation given to your orchestrator as well as the descriptions of the callee Copilots.  

**Note:** Copilots calling other copilots will only reach a max depth of 3 calls.
