_This is a comprehensive in depth guide for Actions. If you’re just getting started, check out [Getting Started With AI Copilots](/copilots/quick-start)._

Credal Actions allow users to create well defined actions that copilots can then use proactively in helping you as your personal assistants. 

Some basic example of actions are: 
- Address Validation 
- Updating Info on collaboration tools (Confluence, Google Drive)
- Consulting with other copilots 

Actions are a powerful tool to make your copilots even stronger than they already are.

## **Action Templates**

_It’s helpful to have a good sense of what you want your actions to do from the start, so you can set it up to achieve its objectives._

To get started:

1. There is an open source directory of action templates which can help you create actions

2. Think of templates as the skeleton of your action, an example being a template to update confluence docs.

3. You can find the open source templates library here: [Credal Action Templates](TODO)

## 1. **Creating Your First Action**

1. To create your first action go to the actions tab on the left sidebar

2. Then click the `Create New Action` button on the top right of the page

3. Fill in the necessary information about your action including the template (note templates are updated reguarly so check back often)

## 2. **Configuring your Action**

1. In this example we selected the `Validate Address on Google Maps` action, now we can see how to configure it.

2. The beauty of actions is that it will try to resolve parameters for you, if you know the fields you'd want to use you can enter them in

3. Go through the parameters list and see what you'd like to hardcode, give options for the AI to decide, or leave up to the AI

**Note:** This specific action hits the Google Maps API

## 3. **Human Governance**

1. You can set your actions to automatically run or require user approval to run (in case it's a sensative action)

2. This can be toggled with the Human Governance Toggle

3. When enabled any action invokation will require you approval before moving forward. This will show up in your conversation as a modal

![copilot_actions_governance_modal](/docs/assets/actions/governance-modal.png)

4. You can see all pending action approvals with the gavel icon in any chat (hidden if you don't have any pending approvals)

![copilot_actions_check_approvals](/docs/assets/actions/check-approvals.png)

## 4. **Connecting Copilots With Actions**

1. A copilot can have any number of actions it's connected to, to connect an action to a copilot go to the copilots page

2. Select the copilot you'd like to connect an action to 

![copilots_table](/docs/assets/copilots/copilot-collaboration/copilots-table.png)

3. Navigate to the Actions tab and search for the action you'd like to connect

![copilot_actions_select](/docs/assets/actions/select-action.png)

4. You can connect any action automatically, however any copilot connection action will require approval: [Read more here](/copilots/copilot-collaboration)

5. Now your copilot can call on actions! It will do this automatically if it's the best action to take
