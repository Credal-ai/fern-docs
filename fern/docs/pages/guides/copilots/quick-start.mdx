Credal's AI Copilots empower users to set up **dedicated assistants** for a wide range of use cases, from customer support to contract review.

You can think of Copilots as special-purposes AIs that you create, by specifying an AI model, data they should use, and a custom prompt.

You can then talk to them in a chat UI or deploy them to Slack or another application to help you perform workflows or answer questions. For example, a Slack Copilot in a channel could listen out for questions about benefits, and answer those. They combine AI with your data to provide accurate, context-aware responses, while citing their sources.

<Steps>
### Create Your Copilot

From the main screen, click “Copilots” in the navigation menu:

<Frame>
  <img src="/docs/assets/copilots/copilots-link.png" width="150" />
</Frame>

Then click “Create Copilot”:

<Frame>
  <img src="/docs/assets/copilots/create-copilot.png" />
</Frame>

Give your copilot a Name and add a Description of its function in the pop-out form. You can always come back and edit these later. _Descriptions should be detailed enough to describe what kind of queries the copilot is responsible for._

<Frame>
  <img src="/docs/assets/copilots/create-copilot-form.png" width="500" />
</Frame>

You can click on “Copilots” in your left sidebar anytime to view the full list of Copilots you've created or that have been shared with you.

### Configure the Copilot

Now your copilot is set up, Credal will automatically direct you to the configure page, where you can tune your copilot for your use case. You can return to this page to edit your settings at any time. (For a detailed explanation of all the options, please see our [Detailed Copilots User Guide](https://www.notion.so/AI-Copilots-In-Depth-Guide-73e09c563d9246cca5241890efef5de4?pvs=21).)

1. Your **Metadata** (Name + Description) will be set already.
2. You can use the default **Model** (GPT-4o) for now, but feel free to experiment with OpenAI o1, Claude or any of the other models too.
3. **Creativity**. We recommend starting with “balanced” or “precise”; “creative” is best for brainstorming, creative writing, or marketing use cases.

  <img src="/docs/assets/copilots/copilot-model-creativity.png" width="400" />
</Frame>

4. **Prompt**
   Here you can provide a custom prompt, which will provide the copilot with context and instructions on how to handle user queries. By default, Credal instructs copilots to be helpful, honest, and to the point and to let users know when it is unsure of the answer.

<Frame>
  <img src="/docs/assets/copilots/copilot-prompt.png" />
</Frame>

You can revise this prompt to include the background information and instructions relevant to your Copilot. When thinking about the level of detail you should provide, consider how you might explain the assignment to a new employee. Your explanation might include:

- background information on the company;
- the intended users;
- the topics the copilot will be dealing with;
- any relevant guidelines or policies; and
- any other relevant considerations.

The content and depth of prompts will vary by use case.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example Prompt: Federal Rules of Court Copilot">
*You are a diligent, objective, detail-oriented, assistant. Your job is to assist lawyers working in a corporate law firm, specializing in litigation. You will answer questions related to the application of rules of civil procedure, including the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the local rules applicable to various district courts. You will respond to questions and prompts truthfully.*

_Instructions:_

- _Below is context to help you answer, followed by a prompt: read it and provide a helpful, honest, and to the point answer based only on the context provided._
- _If you're unsure of an answer, you can say "I don't know" or "I'm not sure"._
- _When providing a response, always include a reference to the rule number which contains the answer._

_The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are procedural rules that apply to civil court cases in United States federal district courts. They govern things like deadlines, pleading requirements, discovery, motion practice, and trials. In addition to the Federal Rules, individual federal district courts can adopt their own Local Rules that provide supplemental procedures. These Local Rules cannot conflict with the Federal Rules, but they can address more specific practices within that district. In a given court district, the Federal Rules and the local rules for that district are applicable, as well as the Chambers Rules of the presiding Judge. Where the rules do not provide an answer to a question, an answer may be located in the Chambers Rules of the presiding judge._

  <Accordion title="Example Prompt: Credal's Information Security Copilot">
    *You are a friendly helpful, honest assistant, who helps Credal company employees answer questions and prompts truthfully about information security questionnaires. Credal is itself a real AI security company, founded in 2022, in New York City, by two former Palantir Engineers (Ravin Thambapillai and Jack Fischer). Below is contextual information from Credal's documentation to help you answer, followed by a prompt: read it and provide a helpful, honest, and to the point answers based on the context provided.

5. **Data**
   The data you provide will be the source of truth for your copilot. Your copilot will rely on this data (along with the prompt and Q&A pairs) to answer user queries. There are two types of data you can specify here:

   - **Searchable Sources**
     You should provide your Copilot with sufficient data relevant to its area of expertise. It will search these sources for information relevant to user questions, and pass just the most relevant information to the AI model. Use the toggle to enable searchable sources and use the search bar to add sources.

     <Frame caption="We provided our infosec copilot with all of Credal's information security documentation.">
       <img src="/docs/assets/copilots/copilot-searchable-data.png" />
     </Frame>

   - **Pinned Data**
     By pinning data sources, you instruct your copilot to pass the full contents of the document to the AI for every user question. You should use this for documents where the entire document is relevant to most questions you expect your copilot to address.
     <Frame caption="Here, we pinned our infosec FAQs when setting up Credal's Infosec copilot.">

     </Frame>

### Deploy Your Copilot to Slack

Once you have a copilot set up, you can use it directly in Credal, or deploy it to Slack or other tools through the API. You can set up a deployment in the “Deploy” tab. For this short guide, we'll cover Slack only; please refer to the detailed guide for the other options.

To deploy a copilot through Slack, simply use the below toggle to turn on Slack deployments and select the channel(s) you want to deploy it to.

<Frame>
  <img src="/docs/assets/copilots/copilot-deploy-to-slack.png" />
</Frame>

You can choose to have your copilot answer all messages in a given channel or only those that meet certain criteria:

<Frame>
  <img src="/docs/assets/copilots/copilot-deploy-to-slack.png" />
</Frame>

- **All messages**: will answer all queries in the connected Slack channel.
- **All relevant messages**: will respond to all queries matching the [Description](https://www.notion.so/Getting-Started-With-AI-Copilots-171cfe73b8df496a9db29f60046eaf06?pvs=21) of the copilot.
- **All messages matching filter**: will respond to messages that match the filter criteria. In the example in the screenshot, the copilot will only respond to prompts containing “?”.

  <img src="/docs/assets/copilots/relevant-slack.png" />
</Frame>

  <img src="/docs/assets/copilots/relevant-slack-filter.png" />
</Frame>

If more than one copilot is deployed to a given Slack channel, Credal will triage user requests based on the Description of each copilot to determine which, if any, should answer the question.
