Credal's AI copilots empower users to set up dedicated assistants for a wide range of use cases, from customer support to contract review.

Copilots can assist with any task that combines AI and data. Copilots are designed to be experts on the data and context you provide. They combine AI with your data to provide accurate, context-aware responses, while citing their sources.

Copilots can participate in your Slack channels, be directly accessed in Credal, or respond via API in your own app or backend service.
