# Writing a Background Prompt

Background prompts are a powerful tool for guiding your agent's behavior. They provide context and instructions to the agent, helping it to understand its role and how to respond to user queries.
The background prompt controls everything from the agent's tone, to the actions it can call, and to the output format it should use. A good background prompt can make the difference between an agent that is helpful and one that is not.
