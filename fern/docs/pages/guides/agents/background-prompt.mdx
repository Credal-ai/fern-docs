# Writing a Background Prompt

Background prompts are a powerful tool for guiding your agent's behavior. They provide context and instructions to the agent, helping it to understand its role and how to respond to user queries.
The background prompt controls everything from the agent's tone, to the actions it can call, and to the output format it should use. A good background prompt can make the difference between an agent that is helpful and one that is not.
Here is an overview of all the information that is included in a Credal background prompt and how you can use it to guide your agent:

## Role
Who is the agent? What is their job title? What is their role in the company? Knowing who the agent is will help it understand what it is doing and how to respond to user queries.

## Goal
What is the agent supposed to accomplish? This will help the agent understand what the end result should look like to make sure it is properly helping the user.

## Instructions
What steps should the agent take to achieve its ultimate goal? This section controls the overall workflow of the agent. If you want the agent to call actions in a specific order, ask the user for more
information at a specific point, or look at specific data before making a decision, you can specify that all here.

See the prompt example in ![attaching actions to agents](/docs/pages/guides/agents/attaching-actions.mdx) for more details.

## Provided Prompt Snippets

Credal has prompt snippets right under the background prompt in the Agent Configuration tab.
