## Basic Testing
Great! Now that you've setup your snowflake action you can start testing it.

Before we get into testing your query lets take a step back and ensure that our snowflake connection is working and we have the correct permissions to query the tables that we're interested in.

For this we can create a generic **runSnowflakeQuery** Action with all parameters predefined, where the query parameter is a simple query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM DB_NAME.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;
```

## Testing Steps
Now that we've tested something basic, we can test out our Snowflake Agent.

1. Ensure connection and permissions are setup by following basic testing steps above.
2. Ask an Agent to answer a question based on the tables it has available (e.g `Give me the revenue for (Company Name) in (Year Number)`)
3. Wait until the response is generated to look at query ran, the query results, and the output.

#### Example Action Ran (Views Approach): 
 - This result was using snowflake data we have at credal.
 - Once the data is queried, it's passed to Open AI Code Interpreter to be processed.

#### Example Action Output: 
- You can see the action parameters and output if you click the **Steps** Table
- **Debugging Tip**: the steps tab is not shown if an action was not run
