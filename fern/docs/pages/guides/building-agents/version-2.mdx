# Searching Internal and External Knowledge

## Version 2 of The Orienteer
1. User asks a question
2. Agent consults the shared FAQ and answer quickly if it exists. 
3. Otherwise, consult the company knowledge base to find the answer to the userâ€™s question
4. If more information is required to answer the question, or if the answer is incomplete, search the web for supplementary details.
5. If no answer exists, send the question to the public #onboarding channel where a hiring manager or peer can respond
6. Return to the user with an update
