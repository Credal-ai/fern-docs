# Improving Internal Systems


## Version 3 of The Orienteer
1. User asks a question
2. Agent consults the shared FAQ and answer quickly if it exists. 
3. Otherwise, consult the company knowledge base to find the answer to the userâ€™s question
4. If more information is required to answer the question, or if the answer is incomplete, search the web for supplementary details.
5. If no answer exists, send the question to the public #onboarding channel where a hiring manager or peer can respond
6. Respond to the user with what happened (and hopefully an answer!) while soliciting feedback about things that were unclear for the agent builder and hiring manager to make the process smoother
7. If the feedback is actionable (requires a bug fix, or any other human intervention), create a Jira ticket in the ONB Credal Project 
8. If the feedback is positive and the answer was helpful and correct, initiate the process to update the FAQ document with the Q/A pair
