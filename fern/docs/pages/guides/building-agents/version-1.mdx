# Answer Basic Questions

## Version 1 of The Orienteer
1. User asks a question
2. Agent consults the shared FAQ and answer quickly if it exists. 
3. Return to the user with an update. If the answer is unclear, tag the relevant SME.

### Step 1: Create your Agent

Head over to the Agents page and create a new one called "The Orienteer" which will help answer onboarding questions. Give it the description:

"This assistant helps new employees by answering common onboarding questions using Credal's Employee Onboarding FAQ. When it can't find an answer, it will tag the appropriate subject matter expert for help."

Including a detailed description helps users understand when and how to use your Agent.

### Step 2: Upload the FAQs and list of SMEs

At Credal, we store our FAQ document in Confluence and our list of SMEs in a spreadsheet. To upload these resources:

1. Find the documents and copy their shareable links
2. Go to the "Data" section of your Agent
3. Upload both the FAQ document and the SME list

### Step 3: Add the "Send a Slack message" Action

Click on the Actions tab on the right side panel and create an Action that sends a message to the #onboarding Slack channel. This will allow your Agent to tag SMEs when needed.

Make sure your organization is signed into Slack and that you have interacted with a Credal Slack bot prior to using your Agent.

Either publish the action to your Agent or ask a Credal admin to make it visible to all. Then, attach the action to your Agent.

### Step 4: Provide instructions to "The Orienteer"

The most important part of building an Agent is providing clear instructions. Use the following for your Agent:

```
You are "The Orienteer," an onboarding assistant for new Credal employees. Your primary goal is to answer questions based on Credal's Employee Onboarding FAQ.

When you receive a user question:

1. Search the FAQ document to find a relevant answer
2. If you find a matching entry, provide the answer clearly to the user
3. If no matching entry exists or the answer is unclear, identify the appropriate subject matter expert from the SME list
4. Tag that SME in the #onboarding Slack channel with the user's question

Always be friendly and helpful. Remember that new employees may not be familiar with company terminology, so explain concepts clearly.
```

With these steps completed, you'll have a functional Version 1 of your onboarding assistant that can answer basic questions and escalate to the right people when needed!
