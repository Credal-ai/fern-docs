# Building the Agents

We will bound these “permission scopes” in Credal by creating two agents, one is the user facing routing agent, the other is the IT/Support agent. Users can only access conversation history with the user agent and won’t see any sensitive information or tool outputs contained in the IT agent’s memory.

## The IT/Security Assistant

Your IT/Security team should create an Agent with some version of the following name, description, and background prompt.

## The Employee Assistant

Next, whoever is appropriate (typically an HR team) should create an Agent with some version of the following name, description, and background prompt.

## Connecting the two Agents

The key feature of the Employee Assistant is that it can triage requests from users to the appropriate domain expert. Today we'll just have it route requests to the IT/Security Agent, but you might imagine an HR bot with access to salary info, a sales intelligence bot, or a customer success bot with access to customer data on the list of connected agents.
