# Deploying to Slack

The last step here is deploying our Employee Assistant to Slack, where people submit requests today.

You now have a fully automated recovery key retrieval workflow built in Credal that only requires a single click from an IT employee. Full permissions and accountability applied.

Let us know if you have any questions, and we would love to hear more about the cool stuff you want to build next!
