# Building Agents in Credal

Welcome to Credal Agents! We've recently rebranded our "Copilots" to "Agents" to better reflect their role as AI assistants that can help automate workflows, answer questions, and support your team.

## What are Agents?

Agents are AI assistants you can customize to perform specific functions within your organization. They can access your company knowledge, follow defined processes, and interact conversationally with your team members to help them accomplish tasks more efficiently.

## Getting Started with Agents

For a comprehensive understanding of Agents and their capabilities, check out our [In-Depth Agent Guide](link-to-guide). This resource covers everything from basic setup to advanced configurations, including:
- Creating your first Agent
- Connecting knowledge sources
- Setting up custom workflows
- Best practices for prompt engineering
- Monitoring and improving Agent performance

## Building Your Onboarding Buddy: The Orienteer

In this guide, we'll walk you through creating "The Orienteer" - an employee onboarding assistant that will help new team members get up to speed quickly. We'll take an iterative approach, building in three distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Answer Basic Questions
We'll create a foundation where your Agent can:
- Respond to user questions by consulting a shared FAQ
- Provide quick answers when information is readily available
- Tag relevant subject matter experts when answers are unclear

### Phase 2: Search Internal and External Knowledge
We'll enhance your Agent's capabilities to:
- Consult the company knowledge base when FAQs don't have the answer
- Search the web for supplementary information when needed
- Provide more comprehensive responses to user inquiries

### Phase 3: Connect with Internal Systems
We'll optimize your Agent by adding:
- Ability to solicit and process user feedback
- Integration with Jira to create tickets for actionable feedback
- Automated processes to update the FAQ with new Q&A pairs

This incremental development approach allows you to:
- Deploy useful functionality quickly
- Gather feedback at each stage
- Refine your Agent based on real user interactions
- Add complexity only where it delivers value
