# Creating an Employee Onboarding Buddy

This guide will walk you through the process of developing an effective employee onboarding assistant using Credal. Rather than attempting to build the complete solution at once, we'll take an iterative approach, starting with a simple foundation and progressively enhancing functionality.

We'll begin with Version 1—a basic but fully functional implementation—and systematically build toward a sophisticated onboarding solution. Each version will be operational on its own while serving as the foundation for subsequent improvements.

This incremental development approach allows you to:
- Deploy useful functionality quickly
- Gather feedback at each stage
- Refine the agent based on real user interactions
- Add complexity only where it delivers value

Let's dig right in!
