# Creating an Employee Onboarding Assistant

The most exciting aspect of developing Agents is leveraging your creativity to solve real business challenges. Don't worry - while we'll cover all the possibilities, you can start simple and build up gradually!

## Step 1: Envisioning Your Onboarding Assistant

Think about what would make onboarding easier at your organization. An effective onboarding assistant might:

1. **Answer Common Questions**: Provide quick responses about company policies, benefits, and procedures
2. **Share Resources**: Direct new hires to important documentation and training materials
3. **Connect People**: Help new employees find the right team members to speak with
4. **Gather Feedback**: Collect insights to improve the onboarding process

Remember, you don't need to implement all these features at once! Start with what delivers the most immediate value.

## Step 2: Planning Your Approach

Before building, consider these key questions:

1. **What knowledge will your Agent need?** Think about existing FAQs, handbooks, or guides
2. **Where will your Agent live?** Consider where new hires would most easily access it
3. **Who will maintain it?** Identify who will keep the Agent's knowledge current
4. **How should interactions flow?** Map out simple conversation patterns to start

The beauty of Credal Agents is that you can start with a simple implementation and enhance it over time as you learn what works best for your team.
