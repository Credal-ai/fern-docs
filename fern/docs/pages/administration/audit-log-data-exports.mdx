# Audit Log / Data Exports

Credal provides comprehensive audit log and data export functionality, enabling you to export audit logs and platform data to your own data warehouse or analytics platform for compliance, security monitoring, and analysis purposes. For user provisioning and access control, see [Single Sign-On (SSO)](/user-guide/platform/administration/single-sign-on-sso).

This functionality is built on Fivetran's Hybrid Deployment offering, ensuring all data stays resident within accounts managed by Credal or your own organization, maintaining complete data sovereignty.

The offering is currently in "beta" status and has been used internally at Credal since August 2025.

In addition to audit log exports, other types of data exports are available e.g. agent metadata. Contact your Credal representative for more information about additional export options.
