subtitle: Configure enterprise authentication for your Credal deployment
---

## Overview

Credal works out of the box with OAuth authentication for Google and Microsoft, providing immediate access for your team. However, for enterprise deployments, we strongly recommend implementing SAML/SCIM for enhanced security and user management capabilities.

## SAML/SCIM (Recommended)

For enterprise organizations, we recommend upgrading to SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) with SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) provisioning.

SAML is an alternative to OAuth while SCIM allows for synchronous user and group data push. For example, SCIM allows instant deactivation of offboarded employees in Credal.ai and other third-party apps.

### Additional RBAC Controls

Enabling group-push via SAML/SCIM allows administrators to configure group access to roles in Credal such as administrator/developer.

### Benefits of SAML/SCIM

- **Automated User Provisioning** - Automatically create user accounts when added to your identity provider
- **Real-time Deprovisioning** - Immediately revoke access when users leave your organization
- **Group Management** - Sync organizational groups and permissions

### Supported Identity Providers

Credal supports virtually all identity providers, including Okta, Azure Active Directory, and other SAML 2.0 compliant providers.
