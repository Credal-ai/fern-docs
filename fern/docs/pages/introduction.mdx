## What is Credal?

Credal is a platform that allows enterprises to build specialized AI agents for any workflow across your company knowledge, enterprise security controls built in.

## What is an agent?

An agent is a system that can reason about its environment or goals and take actions to achieve them. It combines two key capabilities:
1. Reasoning: analyzing available information, context, or instructions to decide what to do next.
2. Action-taking: performing tasks or making changes based on its reasoning, such as calling tools, generating outputs, or interacting with external systems.

An agent differs from a typical chatbot or assistant in that it not only responds to queries but can also reason about goals and take actions to achieve them. For example, a chatbot might answer, “It’s 75°F and sunny in New York,” while an agent could handle a request like, “Book me a flight to New York for tomorrow,” by searching flights, selecting the best option, and completing the booking. In short, chatbots respond, while agents reason and act.

## Why Credal

1. **Enterprise Data Integrations**: Connect to all major enterprise data sources—Slack, Confluence, Google Drive, Salesforce, databases, and more—for unified search, knowledge retrieval, and advanced analytics. Enterprise-grade security ensures that every API connection and query respects your organization’s access controls, so your agents can safely surface insights and documents across your company knowledge. Whether answering questions, powering business processes, or enabling complex workflows, your data remains fully protected.

2. **Agentic Capabilities**: Build intelligent agents that collaborate to execute multi-step workflows across your enterprise data. Agents automatically share capabilities: when one agent learns to query Salesforce, every agent in your organization can leverage that skill. Design sophisticated, secure workflows where specialized agents coordinate on complex tasks—accelerating decision-making without compromising data governance.

3. **Deploy Anywhere**: Bring your agents wherever your teams work. Deploy them to web, Slack, APIs, other agents, or to any chat interface (with more integrations coming soon). Every deployment inherits Credal’s enterprise-grade security, ensuring your knowledge stays private while your teams stay productive.
