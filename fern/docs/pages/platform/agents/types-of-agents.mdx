# Types of Agents in Credal

In our platform today, you can build three kinds of agents:

1. **Domain Specialists**
2. **Operations Engines**
3. **Personal Assistants**

This guide will walk you through the definitions of each agent, what you might use them for, and how to build them. The configuration process for each has the same toggles, but this guide is meant to help you refine your building and problem decomposition process depending on where your use case falls.

## Domain Specialists

**Definition:**  
Domain Specialists are agents that understand your data and expertise extremely well. They are designed to handle specific questions within a particular domain, leveraging deep knowledge and insights to provide accurate and relevant outputs.

**Use Cases:**  
- Analyzing complex datasets to extract meaningful insights.
- Providing expert recommendations based on industry-specific knowledge.
- Automating decision-making processes in specialized fields like finance, healthcare, or legal.

**How to Build:**  
1. **Define the Domain:** Clearly outline the scope and boundaries of the domain the agent will specialize in.
2. **Data Collection:** Gather relevant data that the agent will need to understand and process.
3. **Training:** Use domain-specific datasets to train the agent, ensuring it can accurately interpret and respond to queries.
4. **Testing and Validation:** Continuously test the agent's performance and validate its outputs against known benchmarks.

## Operations Engines

**Definition:**  
Operations Engines are agents that follow your detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to carry out intricate, context-driven procedures. They are designed to automate and optimize operational workflows.

**Use Cases:**  
- Automating routine business processes such as order processing or inventory management.
- Ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements by following predefined procedures.
- Streamlining complex workflows to improve efficiency and reduce errors.

**How to Build:**  
1. **Document SOPs:** Clearly document the procedures the agent will follow, including any decision points and exceptions.
2. **Workflow Design:** Map out the workflow the agent will automate, identifying key inputs, outputs, and dependencies.
3. **Integration:** Ensure the agent can integrate with existing systems and data sources to execute tasks effectively. You will likely consult a domain specialist for this!
4. **Monitoring and Optimization:** Implement monitoring tools to track the agent's performance and make adjustments as needed to optimize efficiency.

## Personal Assistants

**Definition:**  
Personal Assistants are agents designed to help you with whatever you need, providing support and assistance across a wide range of tasks.

**Use Cases:**  
- Managing schedules and appointments.
- Providing reminders and alerts for important tasks.
- Assisting with information retrieval and basic research.
