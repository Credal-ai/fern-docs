## What are MCP Servers?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers are standardized integrations that allow your agent to connect with external tools and data sources. They provide a consistent way to extend your agent's capabilities beyond built-in features.

## Attaching MCP Servers to Your Agent

You can attach MCP servers to your agent to give it access to additional tools and functionality. MCP servers can provide:

- Access to external APIs and services
- Custom data retrieval capabilities
- Specialized processing tools
- Integration with third-party platforms

### How to Add an MCP Server

1. Navigate to the **Add Connectors** section in your Agent Configuration
2. Select **Credal MCP Servers**
3. Choose from available MCP servers in your organization
4. Configure any required settings or permissions
5. Save your changes

Once attached, your agent will be able to use the tools and capabilities provided by the MCP server during conversations.

### Best Practices

- Only attach MCP servers that are relevant to your agent's purpose
- Review the capabilities and permissions of each MCP server before attaching
- Test your agent after adding MCP servers to ensure they work as expected
- Monitor usage to understand how the agent is utilizing MCP server tools
