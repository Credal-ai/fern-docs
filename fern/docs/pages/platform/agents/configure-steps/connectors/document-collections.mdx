# Data Processing Tools

## Summary

Welcome to the feature set for our platform! Below you'll find two key capabilities designed to enhance your workflow with document collections.
Whether you want to ask every document collection about a list of key topics based on your query, or filter semi-structured documents with Smart Filters, there are tools you can use.

### Deep Summarize on Documents

When enabled, the agent queries every document in each selected collection against key topics derived from your query, then synthesizes cross-document results for higher-quality overviews, lists, and summaries.

### Smart Filters

Smart Filtering lets your agent use document metadata and auto-extracted entities to filter out to the most relevant documents, sending only the most relevant content to the LLM, improving precision and reducing noise.

## Deep Summarize on Documents

**Deep Summarize** asks each document in your selected collections targeted questions based on your query, then merges the answers into a concise, structured synthesis. This produces summaries that:

- Pull in **only the most relevant points** from each document
- Organize findings into clear sections or bullet lists
- Capture **key insights, decisions, action items, and risks** across sources
- Draw from multiple documents, not just one

### How to Enable:

**Best Practices**

- Include must-answer questions or focus areas to steer extraction
- For very large documents, ensure they’re split into sections for better coverage and accuracy

### When you shouldn't use it:

- Deep Summarize is very powerful for getting responses for multiple documents
- However if you know that there are only a few relevant documents you want answers from, this will dilute those results.

## Smart Filters

Smart Filtering narrows searches to documents matching specific metadata or entities, ensuring only the most relevant content is sent to the LLM.

- Smart Filtering only works on document collections
- Filters items in a document collection by SQL queries to select on relevant documents
- For smart filtering to work you need to setup metadata schema for your document collection
- The benefit is that you can draw insights from many more documents in your collection

### Example: Smart Filtering

1. Enable Smart Filtering:

   <Frame>
     <img src="/docs/assets/agents/search-tools/deep-summarize.png" />
   </Frame>

2. Setup your document collection with a metadata schema:

   <Frame>
     <img src="/docs/assets/agents/smart-filters/metadata-schema.png" />
   </Frame>

3. Once you have your schema setup, sync/resync your documents to generate metadata

   <Frame>
     <img src="/docs/assets/agents/smart-filters/extracted-values-example.png" />
   </Frame>

4. In your agent, make sure to add prompt instructions to filter on metadata.

5. Send a chat, in the Filters section you can see what smart filers were applied

   </Frame>

### How does smart filtering work:

Smart Filtering works by checking each document’s metadata, schema fields, or auto-extracted entities against your filter criteria.
After that it filters down your searchable set of documents, improving the results generated.
