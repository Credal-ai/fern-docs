title: Actions
---

In this section, you can attach one or more **published actions** to the agent. Actions allow agents to dynamically connect to external systems or trigger workflows based on user input.

- Use the dropdown to search for and select an existing published action.
- Choose **Create New Action** to define a new action and link it to this agent.
- Existing actions in the list display their name, creator, and description (e.g., creating a Zendesk ticket, reading emails, posting in Slack channels, or creating Asana tasks).

Attaching the right actions ensures that your agent can not only respond to questions but also execute real-world tasks across integrated systems.
