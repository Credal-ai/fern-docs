# Connectors

Connectors allow you to integrate the systems you use in your day-to-day work with Credal, enabling agents to interact with them seamlessly.

## What You Can Connect

- **Indexed Data** – Sync and search your data sources
  - Best for fast semantic responses
  - Data is synced nightly

- **Actions** – Dynamically interact with your connected systems
  - Best for live data extraction and writing to your systems in real time
  - Supports human-in-the-loop workflows
  - May have slightly higher latency

- **MCP Servers** – Integrate Model Context Protocol servers
  - Connect third-party MCP servers instantly
  - **Build your own custom MCP servers** directly in Credal on top of your data—define custom parameters, descriptions, and logic to tailor exactly how agents interact with your systems

- **Document Collections** – Curated sets of data for specific use cases
  - Curate data for a particular function
  - Use AI entity extraction to enable granular filtering by date ranges, account names, concepts, and more
