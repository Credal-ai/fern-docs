_This is a comprehensive in depth guide for Agents. If you’re just getting started, check out [Getting Started With AI Agents](/user-guide/getting-started/quickstart)._

Credal's AI agents empower users to set up dedicated assistants for a wide range of use cases, from customer support to contract review.

Agents can assist with any task that combines AI and data. They're designed to be experts on the data and context you provide. They combine AI with your data to provide accurate, context-aware responses while citing their sources.

_It's helpful to understand what you want your agent to accomplish from the start, so you can set it up to achieve its objectives._

## Creating Your Agent

**To get started**:

On your left sidebar, select "Agents":

Give your agent a name and add a description of its function in the pop-out form. When configuring your agent, try to be as detailed as you can with the description, as it helps Credal intelligently route queries to the most relevant Agent when you're creating multi-agent workflows.

The description should cover:

- The agent's intended purpose or use case
- Intended audience
- Any special rules or instructions

The name and description can be edited at any time from the Agent Configuration page.

## Sharing Your Agent

You can add collaborators to your agent by selecting "Actions" → "Share" button in the top right of your Agent Configuration page. This is useful for when you want one or more team members to be able to help build and maintain your agent.
