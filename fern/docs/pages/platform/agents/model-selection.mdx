# Picking a Model

A key piece of building an effective agent is choosing the right foundation model for your use case. By default, Credal gives you access to the latest set of models from major providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.

Factors to consider when picking your model:
* **Reasoning capabilities:** Different models across and within providers vary in their ability to execute multi-step reasoning, decomp complex tasks, and adhere to nuanced instructions/guidelines.
* **Domain-specific expertise:** Models also have varying strengths across domains, which include: code generation, creative writing, analysis & research, and image processing.
* **Context window sizes:** Models with bigger context windows are able to take more inputs (e.g., your prompts, queries, data sources like long docs or codebases), which also includes the ability to continue an existing conversation/interaction for longer.
* **Tool calling limitations:** Ability to select the right tools, extract/format requests, make parallel requests, and handle responses (e.g., objects, streaming) can all differ by provider and model.
* **Speed & cost:** Response times for models can vary significantly, along with usage costs.

These factors are assessed using a variety of benchmarks or metrics in practice, and providers are constantly refining them and evaluating tradeoffs: generally, there is expected to be some tension between optimizing for multiple.

When building your agent, it’s a powerful lever to consider based on your own constraints: how quickly the agent needs to respond, what amount of creative freedom it should have, the importance of external tool calling, etc.

Credal can help you make an informed choice, with:
* Short descriptions of each model which cover factors from above
* A “Preview” tab to test agent responses before deploying
* Opinionated responses from our team: just ask us, we’re always happy to provide suggestions

Lastly, if there’s a model you want to use but don’t see in the platform: please feel free to reach out as well so we can get it added!
