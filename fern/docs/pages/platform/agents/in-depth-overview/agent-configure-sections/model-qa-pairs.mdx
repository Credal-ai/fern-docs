title: Model Q&A Pairs
---

In the prompt section, you can also provide some model Q&A pairs. This lets the agent know what a good answer looks like. To add a pair, select the “Add Pair” button and insert your question and answer in the pop-out form.

Your Q&A pairs should reflect the form and depth of response you are looking for. For example, if your agent’s job is to review and summarize documents, your model Q&A should include a model example of a summary, showing the type of information that should be included.
