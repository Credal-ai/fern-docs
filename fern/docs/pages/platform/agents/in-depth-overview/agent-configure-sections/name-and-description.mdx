title: Name and Description
---
When configuring your agent, the first step is to choose a name and description. When more Agents are created, the description can help Credal intelligently route queries to the most relevant Agent, so try to be as descriptive as possible!

The description should cover:
- What the agent should do
- Intended audience
- Any special rules or instructions

The name and description of your agent can be edited at anytime here.
