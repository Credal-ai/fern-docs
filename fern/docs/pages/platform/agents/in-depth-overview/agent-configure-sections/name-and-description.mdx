title: Name and Description
---
When configuring your agent, the first step is to write a name and description. 

Try to be as detailed as you can with the description, as it helps Credal intelligently route queries to the most relevant Agent when you're creating multi-agent workflows.

The description should cover: 
- The agent's intended purpose or use case
- Intended audience
- Any special rules or instructions

The name and description can be edited at any time.
