_This is a comprehensive in depth guide for Agents. If you’re just getting started, check out [Getting Started With AI Agents](/getting-started/quickstart)._

Credal’s AI Agents empower users to set up dedicated assistants for a wide range of use cases, from customer support to contract review.

Agents can assist with any task that combines AI and data. They are designed to be experts on the data and context you provide. They combine AI with your data to provide accurate, context-aware responses, while citing their sources.


_It’s helpful to have a good sense of what you want your agent to do from the start, so you can set it up to achieve its objectives._

**To get started**: 

On your left sidebar, Select “Agents”:

Then select **“Create Agent”**
