The Evaluate tab helps you systematically measure your agent's performance using test questions and scoring rubrics. You can use this feature to monitor response quality over time and gauge the effect of any changes, such as updates to your agent's configuration, data sources, or instructions.

### **Adding Test Cases**

To get started, click the **"Add test case"** button to add test questions.

For each question, you can define a **rubric** that specifies the criteria for a good answer. Rubrics are more flexible than exact expected answers because they allow you to evaluate responses based on key characteristics rather than requiring word-for-word matches.

### **Creating Rubrics**

When creating a rubric, you can specify multiple criteria and assign point values to each. For example:

- "The answer must cite \[specific document name] as a source" (30 points)
- "The answer must correctly identify the number of employees" (40 points)
- "The response should mention both the GTM and Engineering teams" (30 points)

### **Running Evaluations**

Now, click the **"Generate AI Answers"** button in the top right to test your agent against all test cases.

Your agent will generate answers and automatically score them based on your defined rubrics. You'll be able to:

- **View scores** for each test case on a 0-100 scale
- **Compare performance** with the "Past Scores" column, which shows the last 3 evaluation runs
- **Track improvements** as you iterate on your agent's configuration

This systematic approach helps you optimize your agent with confidence, ensuring that changes improve response quality before deploying them to users.
