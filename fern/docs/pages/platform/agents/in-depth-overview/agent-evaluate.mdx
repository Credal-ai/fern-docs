The Evaluate tab helps you systematically test and measure your agent's performance across a set of test questions. You can use this feature to monitor response quality over time and gauge the impact of changes such as prompt updates, data additions, or configuration adjustments.

### Adding Test Cases

Use the "Add Test Case(s)" button to create test questions. You can optionally provide expected answers for reference, though these are not required for evaluation.

### **Creating Rubrics**

For each test question, you can define a custom rubric that specifies what makes a good answer. Rubrics allow you to:

- Set specific criteria the answer should meet (e.g., "Must cite the XYZ document as a source")
- Assign point values to different criteria
- Provide scoring guidance for the evaluation

### **Running Evaluations**

Click "Generate AI Answers" to test your agent against all questions. The agent will generate responses and automatically score them based on your defined rubrics.

### **Tracking Performance**

- View scores for each response based on your rubric criteria
- Compare current scores against past evaluations in the "Past Scores" column
- Monitor how configuration changes impact agent performance across versions
- Use version control to test different agent configurations and compare results

**Note:** The Evaluate tab currently runs tests on your Preview version of the agent.
