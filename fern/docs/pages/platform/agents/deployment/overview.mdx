# Use your Agents where you work

Credal is not going to lock you into a single chat client or provider. We want AI Agents to power your work, *where you work*. Whether you want to automatically trigger an Agent when a sales call finishes, schedule an Agent to run every 3 hours, or have it interface conversationally with users in their platform of choice, we've got you covered.

This section will cover our current list of deployment options. This list is growing, and we would love to hear your input on something you want to do but don't see here today!

Current list of options:
* Deploy to a Slack channel or chat with an Agent in a Slack DM 
* Deploy your Agent via API
* Deploy your Agent to other Credal Agents
* Deploy your Agent to be accessible through the Credal UI

Coming soon:
* Microsoft teams
* MCP Agent access
* Deploy Credal Agents as A2A agents
* Chrome Extension
* Popular chat clients (Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.)
