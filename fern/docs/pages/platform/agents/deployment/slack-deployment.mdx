# Slack Deployment

Credal lets you use Agents to your Slack channels. These agents can answer questions, help with tasks, and provide information based on your company's data. This guide explains how these agents work in Slack and how to set them up.

## The Basics: Bots in Slack
Think of Slack bots like helpful team members that never sleep. When you message them, they respond automatically. There are two types of bots you can use with Credal:

The Credal bot - This is the default bot that comes with Credal
Custom bots - These are specialized bots you can create (like @HRBot for HR questions or @ITBot for tech support)

## How Messages Work
There are two ways that you can interact with a bot:

1. Mentioning a bot directly (@botname)
Type @Credal what's our vacation policy?
Only that specific bot will respond
Like calling someone by name in a meeting

2. General messages (not mentioning anyone)
Type I need help with my laptop
Any bot that's set up to help with that topic might respond
Like asking a question to the whole room

Messages can be sent in the main channel or they can be sent as a reply in a thread.

## How Agents Decide When to Help
When you deploy an Agent to a Slack channel, you are adding to a bucket of Agents that the Credal bot can choose to respond with in that Slack channel to any given message. The Credal bot decides which agent to respond with using the routing configuration in each agent's deployment settings. There are five ways you can deploy an agent's response behavior.

1. "Respond to all messages" - The agent tries to help with every message in the channel. If multiple agents have this setting, the agent configured first will respond.

2. "Respond when a bot is tagged" - The agent only helps when you specifically mention its bot (@botname). This is the Credal bot by default. If multiple agents have this setting, the agent configured first will respond.

3. "Respond to relevant messages" - Credal will look at all of the agents in a Slack channel with this setting and choose which one makes the most sense to respond as based on the user query.

4. "Respond to all messages that match a filter" - Credal will look at the regex filter you define and respond if there's a match.

5. "Respond to all relevant messages that match a fitler" - The above two settings combined. 

## Connecting Agents to custom Slack bots

You can optionally tie any particular agent to a Custom bot for a specialized function. This is a 1 to 1 relationship, so that bot can only respond as that agent and that agent can only be used in Slack channels if its custom app is triggered.

When creating your custom Slack app, refer to the following document and then reach out to a Credal employee to finish the setup process!

Custom bots and the Credal bot behave separately, so if you have both a Custom bot and Credal bot in a channel, it's possible to see both respond based on their deployment settings.
