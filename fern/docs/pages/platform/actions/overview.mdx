_This is a comprehensive, in-depth guide for Actions. If you're just getting started, check out [Getting Started With AI Agents](/getting-started/quickstart)._

Credal Actions allow users to create well-defined actions that agents can use proactively to help you as your personal assistants.

Some basic examples of actions include:

- Address validation
- Updating information in collaboration tools (Confluence, Google Drive)
- Consulting with other agents

Actions are a powerful tool to make your agents even stronger than they already are.

## **Action Templates**

_It's helpful to understand what you want your actions to accomplish from the start, so you can set them up to achieve their objectives._

To get started:

1. Use our open-source directory of action templates to help you create actions

2. Think of templates as the skeleton of your actionâ€”for example, a template to update Confluence docs

3. Find the open-source templates library here: https://github.com/Credal-ai/actions-sdk

**Note:** You can create custom actions to interface with your private internal systems using the "Fetch from an API or trigger a webhook" template and pasting in an OpenAPI spec!

Before we get to creating your first action, let's learn about action parameters!
