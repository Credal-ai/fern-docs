When you create an action, you can give it “parameters.” Think of parameters as blanks to fill in, so the action knows exactly what to update. These are inherited from action templates.

The following types of action parameters are currently supported:

#### 1. AI Generated (default, most common)
Leave the field empty, and let AI figure out the value from context clues or prompt the user for more details.

*Example use case: Let’s say you want AI to help create tasks in Asana based on a product roadmap. With this option, AI will look at the conversation and determine the most reasonable due dates to set for these tasks.*

#### 2. Predefined
For when you know a parameter value should always be the same whenever this action is run.

#### 3. Multi-select
For when the parameter can only be one of a list of specific values, and you want AI to pick the right one from that list.

*Example use case: In Salesforce, when creating a new lead, you could define the Lead Source as “Website,” “Event,” or “Referral.” AI will then choose one based on context about the lead.*

#### 4. Caller-set
For when the value should be a property of the person (or system) running the action, often based on their account information.

*Example use case: A user in Slack wants to open a Jira support ticket by triggering the “Create” action to update Jira with the ticket's details. The ticket holder field in Jira can be automatically be set to the email of the user that ran the action.*

#### 5. Schema
A custom schema, in YAML format, for defining JSON objects including nested fields.

*Example use case: If you have a follow up email template, and want AI to fill in the client name, date, and topic based on the call transcript information, you can define the parameter "Email Copy" as:*

```
Subject: Meeting with ${CLIENT_NAME} on ${DATE}
Body: Hi ${CLIENT_NAME}, looking forward to our meeting on ${DATE} about ${TOPIC}
```

Advanced tip: if you want part of the parameter to be predefined, and let AI decide the rest, you can set the parameter to “Predefined”, then embed the AI-decided parts using the `${PARAM_NAME}` format.
