There are 4 types of action parameters that you can use when creating actions which will give you a strong level of control on how actions are run.

#### 1. Let AI Decide 
- With this option the field is left empty and the Agent will use its knowledge, or will prompt the user for more information to fill in the required fields.

#### 2. Predefined Value
- If you know a parameter value will always be the same whenever this action is run, you can set the field as predefined.

#### 3. Multi-Select
- If you know the parameter's value will be one of multiple options you can set these options with multi-select and let the AI decide which to use.

#### 4. Embedded Parameters
- You can embed parameters into predefined or multi-select values using the `${PARAM_NAME}` format.
These parameters are especially useful when you have a template for the parameter value with fields to fill in (e.g a SQL Query)
- Embedded parameters default to type string (from the Let AI Decide option). If you require a different type, please contact support@credal.ai.
