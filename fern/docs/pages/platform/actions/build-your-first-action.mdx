## 1. **Creating Your First Action**

1. To create your first action, go to the Actions tab in the left sidebar

2. Then click the `Create New Action` button in the top right of the page

3. Fill in the necessary information about your action, including the template (note that templates are updated regularly, so check back often)

## 2. **Configuring Your Action**

1. In this example, we selected the `Validate Address on Google Maps` action. Now we can see how to configure it.

2. The beauty of actions is that they will try to resolve parameters for you. If you know the fields you want to use, you can enter them.

3. Go through the parameters list and decide what you'd like to hardcode, provide options for the AI to choose from, or leave entirely up to the AI

**Note:** This specific action hits the Google Maps API

## 3. **Human Governance**

1. You can set your actions to run automatically or require user approval to run (in case it's a sensitive action)

2. This can be toggled with the Human Governance toggle

3. When enabled, any action invocation will require your approval before moving forward. This will appear in your conversation as a modal

## 4. **Connecting Agents With Actions**

1. Before you can use your action in an agent, you need to publish your action. In the action page, in the top left, click Actions -> Publish Action

![agent_action_publish](/docs/assets/actions/action-publish.png)

2. An agent can have any number of actions connected to it. To connect an action to an agent, go to the Agents page

3. Select the agent you'd like to connect an action to

![agents_table](/docs/assets/copilots/copilot-collaboration/copilots-table.png)

4. Navigate to the Actions tab and search for the action you'd like to connect

![agent_actions_select](/docs/assets/actions/select-action.png)

5. Now your agent can call on actions! It will do this automatically if it's the best action to take
