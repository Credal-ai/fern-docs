# Overview

Credal offers an "Audit Log" export functionality. This functionality is built-on Fivetran's Hybrid Deployment offering (this ensures all data stays resident within accounts managed by Credal or your own organization).

The offering is currently in "beta" status and has been used internally at Credal since August 2025.
