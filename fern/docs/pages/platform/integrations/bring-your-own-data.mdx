## Bring Your Own Data

If Credal doesn't have [out-of-the-box support](/platform/integrations/data-sources-action-providers) for your data source yet, there are several ways to bring your own data to Credal.

### Upload to an existing system

If your content is **low volume** and **changes infrequently**, exporting to PDF or similar and uploading to a supported system like Google Drive or SharePoint offers you simplicity and the fastest setup time.

### REST API

Credal's REST API lets you upload documents and metadata to Credal. You can use this to upload data from any source that you can access programmatically, e.g., custom in-house built systems or proprietary data vendors.
For more information, see the [Document Catalog API](/api-reference/document-catalog/upload-document-contents).

If you wish to opt in to permissions, you can specify permissioned principals in the API calls.

### MongoDB Collection

If you can write your data to a MongoDB collection, Credal can sync this natively and map fields in MongoDB to the various fields (URL, metadata) needed to make a source usable in Credal.
Your administrator can configure this in the Data Sources page. Contact your Credal team for help setting up.
