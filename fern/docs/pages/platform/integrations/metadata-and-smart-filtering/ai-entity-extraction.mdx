AI Entity Extraction allows you to specify a predetermined set of values for a field in a [collection schema](/user-guide/platform/integrations/metadata-and-smart-filtering/collection-schemas), and have an **LLM automatically extract these values** as we crawl data.

> For example, if you had a list of customer documents in Google Drive, or sales call transcripts in SharePoint, you could specify `Customer Name` as an entity and a list of possible customers to try to extract during syncing. This gives you automatic data curation and tagging, and allows users to [filter](/user-guide/platform/integrations/metadata-and-smart-filtering/smart-filtering-beta) on these entities just by asking questions to your agent.
