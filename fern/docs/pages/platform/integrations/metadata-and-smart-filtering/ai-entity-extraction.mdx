AI Entity Extraction allows you to specify a predetermined set of values for a field in a schema, and have an **LLM automatically extract these values** as we crawl data.


> For example, if you had a list of customer documents in Google Drive, or sales call transcripts in SharePoint, you could specify `Customer Name` as an entity and a list of possible customers to try to extract during syncing. This gives you automatic data curation and tagging, and allows users to filter on these entities just by asking questions to your agent.
