# Publishing Your Server

Publishing works the same way for both Credal-built MCP servers and third-party imported servers. The same deployment options, admin setup, and access controls apply to all servers.

## One-Time Admin Setup

To make Credal MCP servers available in Claude or ChatGPT, an admin connects these URLs once at the organization level:

- **Claude**: `https://app.credal.ai/api/user/claude/mcp`
- **ChatGPT**: `https://app.credal.ai/api/user/chatgpt/mcp`

After that, all published MCP servers are automatically available to users in that service.

## Deploy Your Server

Once your MCP server is ready, you have two ways to deploy it. Navigate to the **Publish** tab to configure your settings.

### For Claude and ChatGPT

No additional setup is required per server. Once published, your server is available to all users automatically.

### For Other MCP Clients

For all other surfaces — Cursor, Windsurf, or any custom MCP client — copy the server's direct URL and add it to each client manually.

## Access Control

Regardless of how you publish, MCP server builders can configure end-user allowlists to control exactly which users can access the server within their chat service, giving admins fine-grained control over visibility and access. User groups come from your [identity provider](/user-guide/platform/administration/single-sign-on-sso).
