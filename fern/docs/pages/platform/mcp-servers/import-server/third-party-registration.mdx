# Third-Party Server Registration

Credal isn't limited to servers you build yourself. You can register any third-party MCP server — Granola, Databricks, or any other provider — and instantly get Credal's full governance stack applied to it: access controls, [approval workflows](/user-guide/platform/governed-actions/human-approval-options), usage monitoring, and allowlists, all out of the box.

This means your organization gets a single, governed entry point for every MCP server your teams rely on, whether built internally or sourced externally. Instead of users connecting to third-party servers directly and bypassing your controls, you register them once in Credal and point users there. Governance follows automatically.

## Registering a Third-Party Server

To get started, make sure you have admin access, then navigate to the **MCP Servers** tab and click **Create New MCP Server**. Select **Import a Third-Party MCP Server**.

Give it a name and description, then paste in the server's remote URL.

Follow the OAuth prompts to authenticate with the provider.

Once connected, you'll see a full list of the server's tools, which you can configure and control from that point on.

Credal currently supports OAuth for third-party authentication. User-level private tokens are not yet supported.
