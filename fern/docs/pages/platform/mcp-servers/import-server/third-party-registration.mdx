# Third-party Server Registration

Credal isn't limited to servers you build yourself. You can register any third-party MCP server — Granola, Databricks, or any other provider — and instantly get Credal's full governance stack applied to it: access controls, [approval workflows](/user-guide/platform/governed-actions/human-approval-options), usage monitoring, and allowlists, all out of the box.

This means your organization gets a single, governed entry point for every MCP server your teams rely on, whether built internally or sourced externally. Instead of users connecting to third-party servers directly and bypassing your controls, you register them once in Credal and point users there. Governance comes along for the ride, automatically.

## Registering a third-party server

To get started, make sure you have admin access, then navigate to the **MCP Servers** tab and click **Create New MCP Server**. This time, select **Import a Third-Party MCP Server**.

Give it a name and description, then paste in the server's remote URL.

Credal will walk you through OAuth authentication with the provider to establish the connection.

Once connected, you'll see a full list of the server's tools, which you can configure and control from that point on.

> Credal currently supports OAuth for third-party authentication, with support for user-level private tokens coming in the future.
