# Setting up Controls

For every MCP server, admins can enable or disable individual tools and require [human approval](/user-guide/platform/governed-actions/human-approval-options) before specific actions execute. If a third-party server exposes actions that are too sensitive or not relevant for your organization, simply turn them off. For actions you want to allow but monitor closely, approval enforcement ensures nothing runs without a human sign-off first.
