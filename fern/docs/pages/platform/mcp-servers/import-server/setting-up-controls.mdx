# Setting Up Controls

Admins can enable or disable individual tools on any MCP server and require [human approval](/user-guide/platform/governed-actions/human-approval-options) before specific actions execute. If a third-party server exposes actions that are too sensitive or irrelevant to your organization, turn them off. For actions you want to allow but monitor closely, approval enforcement ensures nothing runs without a human sign-off.
