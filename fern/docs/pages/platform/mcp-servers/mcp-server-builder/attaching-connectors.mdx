# Attaching connectors

Create and customize actions and data, attach them to your MCP server, and use them from anywhere.

![attaching-connectors-to-server](/docs/assets/mcp-servers/create-steps/attaching-connectors-to-server.png)

Attaching data will automatically create and connect a tool called "search_data" - do not remove this tool! If you accidentally do, you can always select it again or it will automatically appear the next time you connect a data source.

Additionally, actions that require human approval are not permitted on MCP servers yet. Stay tuned for when this gets enabled!
