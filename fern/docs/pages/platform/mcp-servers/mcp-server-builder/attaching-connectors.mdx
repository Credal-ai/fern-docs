Add data sources and actions to your server, then use them from any MCP client.

<Callout intent="warning">
  Attaching a data source automatically creates a tool called `search_data`. Do
  not remove it. If you do, re-select it from the tools list or reconnect the
  data source and it will reappear.

Actions that require [human approval](/user-guide/platform/governed-actions/human-approval-options) are not currently supported on MCP servers.
