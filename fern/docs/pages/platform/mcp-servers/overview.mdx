# MCP Servers Overview

Credal's MCP servers let you take everything you've built in Credal — your governed data, tools, and agents — and bring it directly to where your team already works.

Whether your users are in Claude, Slack, Microsoft Teams, ChatGPT, or a custom agentic workflow, Credal publishes a centrally managed context layer to any of these surfaces with minimal setup. The result is consistent, governed AI access across every interface in your organization, without requiring users to change how they work.

## What you can publish

In Credal, you can import an existing server or assemble collections of [data sources](/user-guide/platform/integrations/data-sources-action-providers), tools, and [agents](/user-guide/platform/agent-builder/configuration/setting-up-an-agent), then publish them as an MCP server to any supported destination. Each collection carries the same governance rules wherever it's deployed: access controls, [human approval](/user-guide/platform/governed-actions/human-approval-options) requirements, and usage policies travel with it.

## How governance works

All MCP server activity is subject to Credal's access control and approval enforcement. Admins can require [human-in-the-loop approval](/user-guide/platform/governed-actions/human-approval-options) for sensitive actions, restrict access by user or team, and monitor usage across every connected surface from a single place. There is no governance gap when a tool gets used in Slack versus a custom workflow versus Claude.ai. The rules are the same everywhere.

## Building with MCP

Credal provides a broad library of pre-built tools that can be incorporated into your MCP servers, making it straightforward to connect data sources, trigger actions, and extend capability without building from scratch.
