# Monitoring Usage

Credal logs every MCP server session, regardless of which client originated it. You can drill into individual sessions to see the full message history, action notifications, and a complete [audit trail](/user-guide/platform/administration/audit-log-data-exports) — including the inputs, outputs, and justifications for every action taken. The same depth of visibility you get from native Credal usage applies everywhere.

## Viewing Usage

Visit the **Monitor** tab of any MCP server (Credal-built or imported).
