# Monitoring Usage

Every MCP server session is logged and visible in Credal, regardless of which client it originated from. You can drill into individual sessions to see the full message history, action notifications, and a complete audit trail — including the inputs, outputs, and justifications for every action taken. The same depth of visibility you get from native Credal usage applies everywhere.

To view usage, visit the Monitor tab of your Credal or Imported MCP Server.
