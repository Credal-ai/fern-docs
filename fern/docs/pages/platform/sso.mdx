title: Single Sign-On (SSO)
subtitle: Configure enterprise authentication for your Credal deployment
---

## Overview

Credal works out of the box with OAuth authentication for Google and Microsoft, providing immediate access for your team. However, for enterprise deployments, we strongly recommend implementing SAML/SCIM for enhanced security and user management capabilities.

## OAuth Support

Credal provides native OAuth integration with:

- **Google Workspace** - Sign in with your Google accounts
- **Microsoft 365** - Sign in with your Microsoft accounts

OAuth is ready to use immediately with no additional configuration required.

## SAML/SCIM (Recommended)

For enterprise organizations, we recommend upgrading to SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) with SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) provisioning.

### Benefits of SAML

- **Centralized Identity Management** - Single point of control for user authentication
- **Enhanced Security** - Advanced authentication policies and multi-factor authentication
- **Compliance** - Meets enterprise security and audit requirements
- **Seamless Integration** - Works with existing identity providers (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)

### Benefits of SCIM

- **Automated User Provisioning** - Automatically create user accounts when added to your identity provider
- **Real-time Deprovisioning** - Immediately revoke access when users leave your organization
- **Group Management** - Sync organizational groups and permissions
- **Reduced Admin Overhead** - Eliminate manual user management tasks

### Supported Identity Providers

Credal supports virtually all identity providers, including Okta, Azure Active Directory, and other SAML 2.0 compliant providers.

## Setup

To configure SAML/SCIM for your Credal deployment, please contact your dedicated Credal team. Our team will work with you to:

1. Configure your identity provider settings
2. Set up SAML assertions and attribute mapping
3. Enable SCIM provisioning endpoints
4. Test the integration thoroughly
5. Provide ongoing support

**Contact your Credal team** to get started with SAML/SCIM configuration.

## Security Considerations

- SAML/SCIM provides enterprise-grade security with detailed audit logging
- User permissions are synced with your existing access controls
- Session management follows your organization's security policies
- All authentication flows are encrypted and comply with industry standards
