# Deploying to Slack

The last step here is deploying our agent to Slack, where people submit requests today.

Now is the time to beta test with users and gather feedback on their experience while resolving any issues they may have with the agent. Once you feel confident that things are working, you are ready to save your team loads of time by productionizing this agent. 

Let us know if you have any questions, and we would love to hear more about the cool stuff you want to build next!
