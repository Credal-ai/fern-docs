# Connecting an Agent to a Slack Workflow

Credal now supports triggering agents via Slack Workflows — on a schedule or based on a condition. This unlocks automation use cases that weren't possible before, like sending a daily digest, running a check on a cadence, or automatically responding to events in your workspace.

<Note>
  The agent will respond in the thread of the workflow message rather than posting directly to the channel.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up a Slack Workflow trigger, your agent must already be published to Slack. If you haven't done this yet, follow the [Agents in Slack](/user-guide/platform/agent-builder/publishing-agents/agents-in-slack) guide first.

## Setup

### Step 1: Publish your agent to Slack

In your agent's **Publish** settings, go to **Slack Channels**, enable **Talk to your agent in Slack**, and add the agent to the channel where your Slack Workflow will post.

### Step 2: Enable "Respond to Slack Workflows"

In the same Slack publishing settings, toggle on **Respond to Slack Workflows**.

### Step 3: Paste in your Workflow ID

Copy your Slack Workflow ID and paste it into the **Workflow ID** field in Credal.

<Callout intent="info">
  Make sure the body text of your Slack Workflow message is structured to trigger the agent correctly based on your agent's routing settings (e.g. matching a filter, or triggering on all messages).
</Callout>

## Example use cases

- **Daily digest** – Schedule a workflow to run each morning and have the agent summarize overnight alerts, tickets, or news.
- **Conditional alerts** – Trigger the agent when a specific condition is met in your workflow (e.g. a form submission, an approval event, or an external webhook).
- **Recurring reports** – Run the agent on a weekly cadence to generate and post summaries from connected data sources.
