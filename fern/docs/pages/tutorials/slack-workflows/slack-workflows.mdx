# Connecting an Agent to a Slack Workflow

Credal now supports triggering agents via Slack Workflows — on a schedule or based on a condition. This unlocks automation use cases that weren't possible before, like sending a daily digest, running a check on a cadence, or automatically responding to events in your workspace.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up a Slack Workflow trigger, your agent must already be published to Slack. If you haven't done this yet, follow the [Agents in Slack](/user-guide/platform/agent-builder/publishing-agents/agents-in-slack) guide first.

## Setup

### Step 1: Publish your agent to Slack

In your agent's **Publish** settings, go to **Slack Channels**, enable **Talk to your agent in Slack**, and add the agent to the channel where your Slack Workflow will post.

<Callout intent="info">
  Make sure the body text of your Slack Workflow message is structured to trigger the agent correctly based on your agent's routing settings (e.g. matching a filter, or triggering on all messages).
</Callout>

### Step 2: Copy your Workflow ID from Slack

In Slack, open your workflow and copy the Workflow ID. The agent will respond in the thread of the workflow message rather than posting directly to the channel.

### Step 3: Enable "Respond to Slack Workflows"

In the same Slack publishing settings, toggle on **Respond to Slack Workflows**, then paste in your Workflow ID.

## Example use cases

- **Daily digest** – Schedule a workflow to run each morning and have the agent summarize overnight alerts, tickets, or news.
- **Conditional alerts** – Trigger the agent when a specific condition is met in your workflow (e.g. a form submission, an approval event, or an external webhook).
- **Recurring reports** – Run the agent on a weekly cadence to generate and post summaries from connected data sources.
